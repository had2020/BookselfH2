            <h1>About Steven Moreno</h1>
            <p>
                Steven Moreno is a creative individual with a passion for the
                arts and storytelling. He enjoys exploring different forms of
                expression, from sketching and illustration to film and music.
                Steven finds inspiration in cinema and uses it to influence both
                his creative style and his perspective on the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond his artistic interests, Steven values the simple joys in
                lifeâ€”like sharing good music, watching memorable films, and yes,
                enjoying a bowl of ice cream. His blend of creativity,
                curiosity, and appreciation for everyday moments shapes who he
                is both personally and professionally.
